## The concept:

What if you had a chance to save, make yourself happier, and stick it to the dental industry, all in one shot?

<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/smile-it-could-make-you-happier/">Scientific American says</a> that by conciously smiling, we trigger a psychological feedback mechanism
that causes us to be happy. I had an amazing realization last year- I wasn't smiling, and it was because I was unhappy with my teeth. They weren't awful, but they were crooked enough to make
me self conscious. It's very hard to smile when doing so makes you self concious about your teeth- every single time. By avoiding smiling, I was dampening my own potential for spontaneous happiness!

I took a mold of my teeth with some cheap alginate powder, Permastone, and a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amosdudley/weblog/8540c6c26da217d62cc43f72e1dd9ee43f825a6e/Impression%20Tray.stl">3d printed impression tray</a>, to get a better picture of what was really going on.
Notice LI-r (right lateral incisor) projected outward, and CI-r (right central incisor) depressed inward and overlapping. 

At the time of writing this, I'm an undergrad, which means that a) I'm broke, and b) I have access to expensive digital fabrication tools. I was researching [name brand clear-aligner treatment],
and I ran across a photo that caught my eye.

Those look like the layer striations from a 3D print!

What is to stop someone, who has access to a 3D printer, from making their own orthodontic aligners?

Turns out, not much! Except for an instict for self-preservation (If you want to lose your lunch, search Google to see how amateur wire braces can go horribly wrong).

More research led me to the professional process for clear orthodontic alignment:

- The dentist assesses your teeth for suitability for the procedure. Old-school bracket braces can move your teeth in basically any direction or rotation, but plastic aligners can only exert
tipping / rotational forces on the teeth. When you put pressure on the crown of a tooth, the crown moves in that direction, and the root moves in the opposite direction
(this is known as Begg's tipping principle). Without being bonded to the tooth, plastic aligners also can't do extrusion (pulling the tooth down and away from the maxillary arch).

- The teeth are 3D scanned. This used to be done by taking an impression, making a mold/casting, and then sending the cast to be accurately scanned. Now, there's in-office tools like iTero that
scan the teeth from within the mouth.

- The 3D model (usually an STL file) is taken into some proprietary orthodontic software, where the teeth are separated into separate objects. A technician plans out a route for the teeth to travel
over the course of the procedure, so that they move but dont intersect one another.

- A series of models is created from the planned route, each representing a step in the motion.

- These models are 3D printed with high accuracy.

- Thermoplastic aligner material is vacuum formed over the 3D printed models.

- The plastic is manually trimmed away and the edges are smoothed, to create a non-irritating aligner. 

So what does one need to do this themselves? Knowledge of orthodontic movement, a 3D scanner, a mold of the teeth, CAD software, a hi-res 3D printer, retainer material, and a vacuum forming machine.
I realized, I had - or could acquire - all of these things. <a href="http://amosdudley.com/weblog/A-Minimal-Mendel">I have my own 3D printer</a>, but the dimensional accuracy isn't good enough. The New Jersey Institute of Technology has a digital fabrication
lab with a Stratasys Dimension 1200es. That would do the trick. I tested the machine, and found it could give me X,Y accuracy under .1mm, which was close enough. I think a stereolithography printer like a
Formlabs Form2 would have been even better, since they have vast X,Y resolution and accuracy. Vertical print resolution didn't matter much- the direction of motion was in X and Y, not Z.
The same lab also has a vacuum forming machine, and some NextEngine laser scanners.

## Introducing Orthoprint

My two main reference texts here were Contemporary Orthodontics (5e) by William Proffit DDS, PhD, and Orthodontics at a Glance by Gill Daljit,

I'll take you on a journey through the process:

The alginate mold. These molds are very precise, and capture an amazing amount of detail. There were some bubbles in the mold, but it didn't matter- bubbles would result in protrusions in the casting, which could be
easily removed, and wouldn't affect the vacuum formed aligner.

The method for making the casting was very simple- I put the mold upside down in a yogurt container, and then filled it with liquid Permastone. When it came out, I simply broke off the top to reveal the casting, and
used a razor blade to smooth out the surrounding area. I added two small colored dots to the surface of the casting, which would serve as reference points for scaling the laser scan.

As far as I know, I'm the first person to have tried DIY-ing plastic aligners.
