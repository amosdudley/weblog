## Introduction

I'll start with a list of subjects I'd like to write about. The scope here won't be quite as limited as the header implies.

- Optimizing my Unreal Engine pipeline.
- Visual storytelling for The Big Art Project In My Head.
- Interactive, immersive art and design, as distinct from "games."
- Developing my character design skills.
- Books I'm reading and thoughts about them.
- Building a 3D scanner.
- Designing personalized ergonomics with a 3D scanner and printer.
- What I think is valuable about zen.
