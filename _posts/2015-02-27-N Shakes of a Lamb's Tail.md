My friend Zak likes to advocate the use of self-imposed consequences as a methodology for motivating oneself to action. For example, committing to burn
(or better, donate) a thousand dollars if an important task isn't completed. Monetary consequences are convenient because they easily scale to the importance
of the task. I like this idea - especially if you have a friend who is willing to hold you to your commitments, usually by holding onto your money.

Ideas swirl around in my mind about projects I'd like to accomplish. Especially a larger scale work I could create, that would in some way crystallize my artistic
and philosophical feelings up to this point. An issue with long-term personal projects is that the goal is so far in the future that it's intangible. So, I've decided
to set a deadline for that project, for 9 months from today. If I don't have an interactive prototype by that date, I'm committing to donate 100 hours of volunteer time
to the NYCACC.
